The source code is contained in 2 files:
Book.h contains a generic book handling code 
pricer.cpp contains specific functions to parse the input message format as well as calculate the price according to the requirement

To build, the latest gcc will be required (4.8.0). This is to allow support for C++11 asa well as the emplace function call for std::multiset that was not available in earlier gcc version.

Build command I used:
g++ -lrt -std=c++11 -O3 -Wall pricer.cpp -o pricer

Sample output times and cross check of test results:
