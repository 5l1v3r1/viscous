io -> 
parse message -> fast parser
                 buffer message -> fixParser + attach data dictionary reference
                 + getter and setter functions based on fid and field name via data dictionary reference
                 
TCP callback model => 
Option 1 =>
Single threaded TCP receiver => Single threaded parser and message consolidator => multi threaded executor (per instrument)
Disadvantage - single threaded till executor

Option 2 =>
Multi threaded TCP receiver (how to preserve sequence ?) => multi threaded parser/executor (per instrument)
Disadvantage - Hard to preserve sequencce early in the receiver stage - and will pollute receiver with application specific logic

Next steps -
1. FIXIOHandler - message callback consolidator - hook into Tcp Initiator and acceptor
2. Unit test for FIXMsg

Option 3 => 
Creae a buffer factory for fix message - when call to create a new buffer, pre-copy the prev message onto the buffer
Disadvantage - the factory need to be single threaded
